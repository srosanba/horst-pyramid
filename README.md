In Eric Horst's classic book [How to Climb 5.12](https://www.amazon.com/How-Climb-5-12/dp/0762770295), he introduces the concept of a training pyramid. The idea is that if you want to be able to climb a given grade, you first need to climb lots of routes below that grade. He provides the following template to illustrate the concept.

I thought it would be fun to geek out and produce a pyramid graphic using SAS. Based on the climbs I've completed thus far in 2018 ([csv](https://github.com/srosanba/pyramid/blob/master/ticks.csv)), here is what my pyramids would look like for grades 11a and 11b.

I've built a pretty solid base for 11a and should be making an attempt soon. On the other hand, I've got a ways to go in building up to 11b.
